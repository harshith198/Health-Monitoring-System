# Health-Monitoring-System
The IoT-Based Health Monitoring System is an intelligent, compact, and portable solution developed to address the growing need for continuous and real-time tracking of vital health parameters, particularly in remote,
rural, and home-based care environments. The system employs an Arduino-based microcontroller to serve as the central processing unit, integrating multiple biomedical sensors to monitor key health indicators.
A MAX30100 pulse oximeter sensor is used to measure both heart rate (beats per minute) and blood oxygen saturation (SpO₂), which are essential markers of cardiovascular and respiratory health. Additionally, 
a digital temperature sensor is included to accurately detect the body temperature of the user. The real-time readings from these sensors are immediately displayed on a 16x2 LCD screen with an I2C interface,
providing instant visual feedback to the user or caregiver. For remote monitoring capabilities, the system is equipped with an ESP8266 Wi-Fi module, which transmits the collected health data to a cloud-based 
platform such as ThingSpeak. This cloud integration enables healthcare providers, family members, or remote clinics to access and analyze the patient’s health status over time, identify abnormal trends, and 
make informed medical decisions without physical presence. The combination of real-time data acquisition, wireless transmission, and cloud visualization makes this system a cost-effective and scalable alternative 
to traditional hospital-based monitoring equipment. Moreover, its modular and upgrade-friendly architecture allows for the integration of additional sensors like ECG modules, motion detectors, or blood pressure 
sensors in future versions, making it a robust foundation for advanced health monitoring and telemedicine solutions.
